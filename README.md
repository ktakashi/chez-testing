SRFI 64 for Chez Scheme
=======================

I'm sick and tired of copying Chez specific SRFI 64 implementasion for
each project I've made. So make it a repository so that I can use it
as a git submodule.

How to use it
=============

Chez Scheme doesn't allow us to escape `:` as must of the other implementations
do. To resolve this, you need to run `setup.sh` script before using the library.

Licence
=======

The `README.md` and `setup.sh` files are public domain. I don't clame any
copyright.

The licence of the SRFI implementation is located `lib` directory.
